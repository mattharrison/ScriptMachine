ScriptMachine
=============

A tool for composing scripts/commands and python functions into a
state machine.

Here's the impetus:  I've got a bunch of scripts/functions to do
deployments, updates and weekly batch jobs.  I want something where I
can easily insert commands into the graph.  I want it to be flexible
to easily insert a pre/post command into a sequence.  I also want to
be able to execute arbitrary subgraphs of the graph (pass in start/end
nodes).
